Namaste :pray: everyone !
I am Atibhi Agrawal and if you're reading this you have stumbled upon my personal site on the World Wide Web. :earth_asia:

I'm an Integrated Masters :mortar_board: student at International Institute of Information technology, Bengaluru. I am interested in software Eegineering(pretty broad I know !), distributed systems, open source and Natural Language Processing.
I have done internships at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) in 2019 and was a [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2018-07-30-introducing-team-rubies) in 2018. These internships helped me grow tremendously professionally as well as personally. They are a major reason why I want to pursue software engineering in the future. You can read more about my work and projects [here](http://linkedin.com/in/atibhi-agrawal-267525149/).

<!-- #### Causes I feel strongly about

- __Mental Health__ - Mental health is still a taboo in India.The need for counseling and therapy is looked upon as a weakness. It becomes difficult for a person with a history of mental illness to lead a normal life, socially and professionally. Even colleges do not give access to professional counsellors for their students, making youth extremely vulnerable. During the summer of 2017, I volunteered at a [non-profit organization](http://shishusarothi.org/) that works in the area of early intervention and rehabilitation, education, livelihoods, advocacy, and awareness as well as protection of rights and legal aid for children and persons with disabilities in North East India. I worked with kids who had physical and mental health issues. That was extremely fulfilling for me and motivates me to keep working towards improving mental health. Moreover, the organization that I worked with in Rails Girls Summer of Code was [if-me.org.](https://www.if-me.org/) It is a community for mental health experiences. One of the main reasons why I wanted to work for if-me is because I wanted to destigmatize mental health issues. I built a Reporting and Blocking feature for the community.

- __Women in Tech__ -  I also have a vision of having more underrepresented communities in tech and work strongly towards that. In the year 2018, there were only two females from my college to have ever taken part in any Open Source programs. I wanted to change that and started the Lean In Chapter IIITB. As the founder of this chapter, I have conducted various workshops for freshman and sophomore students. Workshops range from Hacktoberfest workshops to helping them get into open source programs. The best part is that in just a span of three months I was able to increase the number of girls from 2 to 10 ! Yes, this year 10 freshman girls have been selected for Girlscript Summer of Code.  -->

In my free time I can often be found [reading :books:](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74108752-atibhi-agrawal) on my kindle, painting or encouraging girls to take up STEM careers.
