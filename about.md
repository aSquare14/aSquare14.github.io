Namaste 🙏 ! 
If you are reading this, welcome to my blog. I'm Atibhi, a final year Integrated Master student at [IIIT-Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), an aspiring Software Enginner, an advocate for diversity and inclusion in STEM, [open source enthusiast](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source), a voracious reader and an artist.

Presently, I am interested in building distributed systems and algorithms that can scale. I care about building impactful, accessible and inclusive tech for everyone. I am also passionate about diversity in tech and am the founder on Lean In Chapter IIIT-B which is an organization that helps to empower women in technology.💜

In my free time I can often be found [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74108752-atibhi-agrawal) on my kindle 📚. I also have a diploma in Fine Arts and paint whenever inspiration strikes. 🎨
