<p>I'm an undergrad at IIIT Bangalore pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am interested in electronics,low frequency noise measurements and all things tech. </p>
<p>I love FOSS and sometimes surf github more than instagram.Collaborating with people and making new things makes me happy ! I am also involved in communities that promote diversity in tech .</p>
<p> In my free time, I love reading, listening to music and travelling. I sometimes like to imagine I'm the real life Monica Geller and start organizing things with vengeance. </p>
<p> Presently working as a developer at RGSoC'18 with if-me.</p>
