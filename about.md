![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})
<p>I'm an undergrad at IIIT Bangalore pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering. </p>
<p>I love FOSS and sometimes surf github more than instagram. Collaborating with people and making new things makes me happy ! I am also involved in communities that promote diversity in tech.</p><p> I am passionate about Machine Learning, Software Development, Open Source and all things tech related. In my free time, I take part in hackathons and come up with intelligent solutions to tackle day-to-day problems. I love challenges and enjoy creating an organized schedule for completing a task.
Presently, I am working in the field of Visual Recognition(VR) and NLP. I am working on abstractive summarization of NPTEL transcripts so that students can get the gist of the video from the text itself instead of going through the entire video. 
I have also done Software Engineering internships at IISc and was one of the 13 teams in the world to become a Rails Girls Summer of Code Scholar in 2018.</p>

<p> In my free time, I love reading, listening to music and travelling. I sometimes like to imagine I'm the real life Monica Geller and start organizing things with vengeance. </p>

#### Promoting Diversity and mentoring others :heart:


In November 2018, I was a Google Code In mentor for Public Labs and presently I am a mentor for Open Genus Foundation as a part of Girlscript Summer of Code Program.  I am also a mentor for Learnit girl program which is a mentorship program as a way to help realize Anita Borg's vision of 50% women in computing by 2020. I am providing assistance to my mentee to build a shopping portal in Ruby on Rails.

Apart from this, I also have a vision of having more underrepresented communities in tech and work strongly towards that. In the year 2018, there were only two females from my college to have ever taken part in any Open Source programs. I wanted to change that and started the Lean In Chapter IIITB. As the founder of this chapter, I have conducted various workshops for freshman and sophomore students. Workshops range from Hacktoberfest workshops to helping them get into open source programs. The best part is that in just a span of three months I was able to increase the number of girls from 2 to 10 ! Yes, this year 10 freshman girls have been selected for Girlscript Summer of Code.
