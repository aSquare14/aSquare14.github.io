#### Week 4 of the internship

**Work done** - 
- Worked on **forward** plugin and made changes in the PR. Thank you Fujimoto Seiji for reviewing this PR.
- Also explored influxDB and stackdriver services.

**Things learnt** :) -

- Eduardo told me that we should test every single property of the configuration that I am porting to a config map and the test should involve a real data flow test. I was actually testing the plugins but not using every parameter, just using the basic parameters so this advice was very useful. I shall keep this in mind for future !


#### Plans for next week

- Test every plugin for which I have regsitered config maps till now.
- I don't want to work on newer plugins till the old ones are merged, so this week I plan to work on my old PRs and try to get them merged . :)
