#### Week 9.5 of the internship

**Work done**

- This week I had issues with my laptop and I spent 1.5 days to fix it and setup fluent-bit again.
- I worked on out-azure plugin that was reviewed and examined the existing parameter handlings one
by one and tested out each and every line of them.
- Apart from this, I studied the codebase and made a list of my doubts.I also tried resolving them but I hit a roadblock at some point.
I am trying to co-ordinate with my mentors so that we can clear it at the earliest.
