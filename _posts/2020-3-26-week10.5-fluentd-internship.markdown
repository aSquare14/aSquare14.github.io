#### Week 10.5 of the internship

**Work done**

- out-azure Plugin
  - Made changes as requested by fujimotos. Checked existing parameter handlings one by one and removed assignments of some parameters
  to leverage the config map. 
  - Updated the documentation for out-azure. Added missing parameter time_key. [Link](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docs/pull/283). 
  - Removed trailing whitespaces. Found this cool [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3372822/git-trim-whitespace) on the same. 
  
- External out-tcp plugin in [fluent-bit/plugins](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-plugin/pulls)
  - Added gitignore file in the repository. [Link](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-plugin/pull/6)
  - Updated my [PR](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-plugin/pull/5) for the external plugin. Took care of memory leaks, assignments,
  case when tcp server is not found as well as added comments to make the code more readable. Waiting for review on this PR.
  
#### Plans for next week

- Continue working on newer plugins
