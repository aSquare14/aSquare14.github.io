#### Week 11 of the internship

**Work done**

- [Developer Guide](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/blob/master/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
  - While writing [documentation for the out_tcp2 plugin](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-plugin/blob/c83d745ac5f47718c78319006765285e93e8f884/README.md
  ) I came across the developer guide in fluent-bit repository. I was so surprised that I missed it earlier.
  - I proceeded to add a link to the README which sends a beginner to the guide. I also corrected a typo in the guide.(Merged)
  - I went through the guide in detail as well as the external links and libraries mentioned. This took me almost 1.5-2 days but it
  was worth it because I gained a lot of knowledge as well as consolidated my existing knowledge.
  - I then proceeded to add documentation about config maps in the developer guide. [PR Link](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/pull/2060/files
